Due to a library bug there is a small issue in the next video. In the next lecture you'll learn how to setup source maps by setting a "devtool" property in webpack.config.js. In the lecture I set the value to "cheap-module-eval-source-map". This might cause the source maps to not work as shown in the video.

If you are getting this error, try setting the value to either "inline-source-map" or "eval-source-map" instead.
